		///		Reprecents z-base-32[6] a Base32 encoding designed to be easier for human use and more compact. It includes 1, 8 and 9 but excludes l, v and 2. It also permutes the alphabet so that the easier characters are the ones that occur more frequently. It compactly encodes bitstrings whose length in bits is not a multiple of 8, and omits trailing padding characters.

It also excludes the letter U to reduce the likelihood of accidental obscenity.

		///		Triacontakaidecimal is another alternative design for Base 32, which extends hexadecimal in a more natural way and was first proposed by Christian Lanctot, a programmer working at Sage software, in a letter to Dr. Dobb's magazine in March 1999[8] as a proposed solution for solving the Y2K bug and referred to as "Double Hex". This version was described in RFC 2938 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2938 under the name "Base-32".
